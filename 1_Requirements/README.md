<h2>
  Opportunities –
</h2>
<h4>
  The stationery billing system leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, billing systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of billing systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required to navigate these different spaces and ecosystems.
</h4>
<h2>
  Threats –
</h2>
<h4>
  Sellers now add and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some stores don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable or stole by criminals.
